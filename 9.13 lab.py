9.13 LAB: Artwork label (classes/constructors)

Define the Artist class with a constructor to initialize an artist's information and a print_info() method.
The constructor should by default initialize the artist's name to "unknown" and the years of birth and death to -1. print_info() displays "Artist:",
then a space, then the artist's name, then another space, then the birth and death dates in one of three formats:

    (XXXX to YYYY) if both the birth and death years are nonnegative
    (XXXX to present) if the birth year is nonnegative and the death year is negative
    (unknown) otherwise

Define the Artwork class with a constructor to initialize an artwork's information and a print_info() method.
The constructor should by default initialize the title to "unknown", the year created to -1, and the artist to use the Artist default constructor parameter values.

Ex: If the input is:

Pablo Picasso
1881
1973
Three Musicians
1921

the output is:

Artist: Pablo Picasso (1881 to 1973)
Title: Three Musicians, 1921

Ex: If the input is:

Brice Marden
1938
-1
Distant Muses
2000

the output is:

Artist: Brice Marden (1938 to present)
Title: Distant Muses, 2000

Ex: If the input is:

Banksy
-1
-1
Balloon Girl
2002

the output is:

Artist: Banksy (unknown)
Title: Balloon Girl, 2002
