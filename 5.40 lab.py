Exercise 11: Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range

Note: A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers

Examples:

    6 is not a prime mumber because it can be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
    37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.

Given:

    # range
start = 25
end = 50

Expected output:

Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
29
31
37
41
43
47
